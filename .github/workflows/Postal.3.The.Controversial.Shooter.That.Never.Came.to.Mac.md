# Postal 3: The Controversial Shooter That Never Came to Mac
 
Postal 3 is a third-person shooter video game that was released for Microsoft Windows in December 2011.

The game features a branching storyline with two paths: the "bad path", which involves joining the schemes of corrupt politicians and cult leaders, and the "good path", which involves joining the local police force and fighting crime. The game also features various celebrities and public figures as characters, such as Uwe Boll, Osama bin Laden, and Hugo ChÃ¡vez.
 
However, despite being announced for OS X, Linux, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360, the game was never ported to these platforms. The developers, Trashmasters and Running with Scissors, blamed the publisher, Akella, for not fulfilling their contractual obligations and delivering a buggy and unfinished product. The game received mostly negative reviews from critics and fans alike, who criticized its technical issues, poor gameplay, and lack of humor.
 
Postal 3 is considered by many to be one of the worst games ever made, and a stain on the reputation of the Postal franchise. The developers have since disowned the game and focused on improving Postal 2 and developing Postal 4: No Regerts, which are both available for Mac users.

Postal 3 received a score of 24 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 11 reviews, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews". [1] IGN gave the game a score of 5.5 out of 10, stating that "Postal III is a bad game, but not bad enough to be good." [2] GameSpot gave the game a score of 3 out of 10, calling it "a technical disaster and an artistic embarrassment." [3] PC Gamer gave the game a score of 21 out of 100, saying that "Postal III is an awful game made by people who don't know how to make games." [4]
 
The game was also criticized by fans of the Postal series, who felt that it betrayed the spirit and style of the previous games. Many fans preferred Postal 2, which offered more freedom, variety, and humor. The developers of Postal 3 acknowledged the negative feedback and apologized to the fans for the poor quality of the game. They also blamed the publisher Akella for rushing the game's release and interfering with their creative vision. They claimed that they had no control over the final product and that they were not paid for their work. [5]
 
In 2016, Running with Scissors released Postal Redux, a remastered version of the original Postal game, for Windows and OS X. The game received mixed reviews from critics and fans, who praised its improved graphics and gameplay, but criticized its short length and lack of innovation. [6] In 2019, Running with Scissors released Postal 4: No Regerts, a sequel to Postal 2, for Windows and Linux. The game is currently in early access and has received positive reviews from critics and fans, who praised its return to the open-world sandbox style and its humor. [7] The developers have stated that they plan to release Postal 4 for OS X in the future. [8]
