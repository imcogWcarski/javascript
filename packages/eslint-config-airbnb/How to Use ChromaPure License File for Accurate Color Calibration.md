ChromaPure is a video calibration software that allows you to adjust the color and contrast of your display to achieve optimal image quality.

That's where ChromaPure license file comes in. ChromaPure license file is a file that contains calibration data for your specific colorimeter and display type. It is generated by using a reference spectroradiometer, which is a device that measures the spectrum of light emitted by your display. By applying the ChromaPure license file to your colorimeter, you can improve its accuracy and reduce errors.
 
One of the colorimeters that ChromaPure supports is the SpyderX PRO , which is an affordable and fast device that offers multiple correction modes for different display types. These correction modes are built-in to the ChromaPure license file, and you can select them when you initialize the meter within ChromaPure. For example, if you are calibrating a front projector, you can choose the Front Projector mode, which will apply the appropriate correction for that display type.
